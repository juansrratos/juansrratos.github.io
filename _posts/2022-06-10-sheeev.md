In this post, and the ones that are going to follow, we attempt to treat the theory of sheaves, albeit at a basic level, with extensive treatment. 

# 1. The Fundamentals

**Definition 1.1.**  Let $X$ be a topological space.

(1) A **presheaf** $\mathscr{F}$ of sets on on $X$ consists of producing a set $\mathscr{F} (U)$ for every open subset $U$ of $X$, and a morphism $\rho_{U, V} \colon \mathscr{F} (U) \to \mathscr{F} (V)$ for every pair of open subsets $V \subseteq U$. Furthermore, $\mathscr{F}$ satisfies the following properties:
1. $\mathscr{F} (\emptyset) = 0$,   
2. $\rho_{UU} = \id_{\mathscr{F} (U)}$ for all open subsets $U \subset X$, and   
3. if we have $W \subset V \subset U \subset X$, then $\rho_{U W} = \rho_{VW} \circ \rho_{UV}$.  

(2) Let $\mathscr F$ and $\mathscr G$ be presheaves of sets on $X$. A morphism $\varphi \colon \mathscr F \to \mathscr G$ consists of the following data:   
1. for each open $U$ in $X$, we have a morphism $\varphi (U) \colon \mathscr F (U) \to \mathscr G(U);$   
2. for each inclusion $i \colon V \to U$, we have that the following diagram commutes

(3) The category of presheaves of sets on $X$ will be denoted $\text{PSh}(X)$.      ◄

The elements of $\mathscr{F}(U)$ are called sections of $\mathscr{F}(U)$ over $U$, and we will use the notation $s \mid_V := \res_{U, V} (s)$ if $s \in \mathscr{F} (U)$ And there's several notations used to describe $\mathscr{F}(U)$: $H^0 (U, \mathscr{F}) = \Gamma (U, \mathscr{F}) = \mathscr{F}(U)$, which we all become of use at some point later on.
We should note that in the above definition, we have the special case of a presheaf of sets. Another, and more general, way to define a presheaf is to be let a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ be defined as a functor from $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$ to the category $\mathbf{Sets}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is just some category. Our above functor above defines a presheaf from the category of open sets of a topological space $X$ to the category of sets. 


***Example 1.1*** If we let $X$ be a topological space and we let $A$ be a set, then the *constant presheaf*$\,$ with value in $A$ is the presheaf where we assign to every open set $U$ of $X$ the set $A$ and the restriction maps are just the identity map $\id_A$. 

**Definition 1.2.** Let $X$ be a topological space. A presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ of abelian groups on $X$ consists of the data:    
(a) for every open subset $U \subset X$, an abelian group $\mathscr{F} (U)$, and      
(b) for every inclusion $V \subset U$ of open subsets of $X$, a morphism of abelian groups $\rho_{UV} \colon \mathscr{F} (U) \to \mathscr{F}(V),$   
which is subject to (1.1), (1.2), and (1.3) of Definition 1.1.

***Example 1.2***  Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that for every $x \in X$, we are given an abelian group $M_x$. Then for every $U \subset X$, we let  \\[ \mathscr{F} (U) = \bigoplus_{x_i \in U} M_{x_i} \\]   
As the presentation of $\mathscr{F}(U)$ suggest, a section of $\mathscr{F}(U)$ can be written as $\sum_{i = 1}^n m_{x_i}$ where $x_i \in U$ and $m_{x_i} \in M_{x_i}$. Additionally, for $V \subset U \subset X$ open, we define a restriction map $\mathscr{F} (U) \to \mathscr{F}(V)$ where we map $s = \sum_{i=1}^n m_{x_i}$ to $\sum_{x_i \in V} m_{x_i} = s \mid_V$.

**Definition 1.3** A **sheaf** is a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ that satisfies two further properties:   
*(Identity Axiom.)* $\,$ If $ \\{U_i \\}\_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $U$, and $f_1, f_2 \in \mathscr{F} (U)$, and $\rho_{U, U_i} f_1 = \rho_{U, U_i} f_2$ for all $i$, then $f_1 = f_2$.   
*(Gluability Axiom.)* $\,$ If $\\{U_i\\}\_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $U$, then given $f_i \in \mathscr{F} (U_i)$ for all $i$, such that $\rho_{U_i, U_i \cap U_j} f_i =\rho_{U_j, U_i \cap U_j} f_j$ for all $i, j$, then there is some $f \in \mathscr (U)$ such that $\rho_{U, U_i} f = f_i$ for all $i$. 


Remark 6. A sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$ on a topological space $X$ is an assignment of a ring $\mathcal{O}_X (U)$ to each open set $U$ in $X$. That is, $\mathcal{O}_X \colon \mathbf{Opn} (X) \to \mathbf{Rings}$ is a sheaf. The sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}_X$ is pronounced as "oh-$X$". The pair $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is called a ringed space (we'll return to this notion soon), and the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ is called the structure sheaf of the ringed space. Lastly, we prescribe a particular name to the sections of $\mathcal{O}_X$; we call them functions, which correspond to an open set $U$ of $X$ (sometimes called regular functions by others). 

Definition 8. Suppose $\pi \colon X \to Y$ is a continuous map, and $\mathscr{F}$ is a presheaf on $X$. Then define $\pi_\ast \mathscr F$ as $\pi_\ast \mathscr{F} (V) := \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1} (V))$, where $V$ is an open subset of $Y$. This called the pushforward or direct image of $\mathscr{F}$. To be more precise, $\pi_\ast \mathscr{F}$ is called the pushforward of $\mathscr{F}$ by $\pi$.

Lemma 1. If $\mathscr F$ is a sheaf, then $\pi_\ast \mathscr F$ is a sheaf as well.

If we are given a sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ of sets on topological space $X$, then we can consider at every point $x \in X$ for which there is an associated set $\mathscr F_x$ called the stalk of $\mathscr F$ at $x$. Furthermore, the stalk of $\mathscr F$ at $x$ is as a colimit of all $\mathscr F (U)$ over all open sets $U$ containing $x$:

$$\mathscr F_x = \varinjlim_{x \in U} \, \mathscr{F} (U).$$

where the colimit is over the set of open neighborhoods $U$ of $x \in X$. The open neighborhoods are partially ordered by reverse inclusion; that is, we say $U \leq U^\prime$ if and only if $U \subset U^\prime$. 

For a refresher, if needed:

Definition. If $X$ is a topological space and $p$ is a point in $X$, then a (open) neighbourhood of $p$ is a (open) subset $V$ of $X$ that includes an open set $U$ containing $p$,

$p \in U \subset  V \subset X.$

The stalk of a presheaf $\mathscr F$ at a point $p$ can be desribed in another way: $$\mathscr F_p = \{ (f, \text{open } U) \colon p \in U, f \in \mathscr F(U) \} / \sim$$ with the equivalence relation that $(f, U) \sim (g, V)$ if and only if there is some open set $W \subset U$, $V$ where $p \in W$ and $\res_{U, W} f =\res_{V, W} g$. Moreover, if $p \in U$ and $f \in \mathscr F (U)$, then the image of $f $ in $\mathscr F_p$ is called the germ of $f$ at $p$. 

The last thing we'll want to discuss in this post is mappings between presheaves and sheaves, as the next post will be the topic we've been building up to and this is the last thing we will need.
